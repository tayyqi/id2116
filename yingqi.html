 <h1>Hi I am Tay Ying Qi</h1>


 <body>
   <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul><p>I am an Industrial Design undergraduate at the National University of Singapore. 
      I have an interest in product and experience design and have worked on packaging 
      and experience design projects in the course of my study. I enjoy exploring 
      different aspects of design and constantly seek to improve my sketching and
      software skills as a designer.</p>
</ul>

    <h2>As a designer </h2>
     <ul> 
      Being an aspiring designer, I seek to find inspiration from many sources. By 
      building this resource bank for myself through my daily experiences and 
      interactions, I would be better able to understand problems from different 
      perspectives and better communicate my ideas to various stakeholders.
     </ul>
     
     <h2>Softwares</h2>
     <ul>Throughout the course of my study I have been regularly exposed to the following softwares:</ul> 
        <ul>Adobe softwares: 
          <li>Photoshop</li> <li>Illustrator</li> <li>After Effects</li> <li>Premiere Pro</li>
        </ul>
