   <h1>Hi I'm John</h1>
   <p>I joined Industrial Design because I liked to imagine how things could be different and make a change. 
    I also joined because I really disliked my Junior College education. 
    I hated the idea of having to take exams and be graded on what I wrote on paper rather than what I could do with that knowledge. 
    In Industrial Design I can finally express what I imagine in my head and not have to explain everything in an essay. 
    As a designer I wish to help people live more comfortably and enjoy their lives more through the products that I design. 
    My design motto is, “Make things beautiful and then makes sure it works.”</p>
  

   <h2>4 strengths as a designer:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>	Rhinoceros, grasshopper and Rendering.</li>
      <li>	Receptive to my surroundings and drawing inspiration from around me.</li>
      <li>	I love working with people and making project work fun!</li>
      <li>	I listen to my group mates ideas and try to understand their ideas.</li>
    </ul>
