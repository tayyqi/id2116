   <h2>I joined Industrial Design because I liked to imagine how things could be different and make a change. 
   I also joined because I really disliked my Junior College education. 
   I hated the idea of having to take exams and be graded on what I wrote on paper rather than what I could do with that knowledge. 
   In Industrial Design I can finally express what I imagine in my head and not have to explain everything in an essay. 
   As a designer I wish to help people live more comfortably and enjoy their lives more through the products that I design. 
   My design motto is, “Make things beautiful and then makes sure it works.”</h2>
