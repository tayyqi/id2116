    <h1>Week2 exploration: Shoebag</h1>
    <p>How can I use a shoebag as a control for my music player?
Using the different motions we can perform on a shoebag we can assign different tasks to each motion.
Vertical movement in picking up the bag will start the music.
Rotating the bag clockwise or anticlockwise could go to the previous or next song.
